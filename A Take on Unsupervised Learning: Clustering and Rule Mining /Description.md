Project Description: This project is a part of my academic where I mostly focused on employing three basic clustering techniques namely DBScan, K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering for analysing clusters on different datasets. Along with exploring the clustering techniques, Apriori Algorithm is utilized for mining association rules on Spotify dataset and ultimately designing a mini recommendation system based on the rules generated.

Core Technologies Utilized:
1. Scikit-learn (sklearn):
•	Essential for machine learning tasks, including clustering algorithms such as DBSCAN, KMeans, and Agglomerative clustering.
•	Provides a wide range of machine learning models, preprocessing techniques, and evaluation metrics.

2. mlxtend (specifically for association rule mining):
•	Used for association rule mining tasks, specifically the Apriori algorithm, implemented through mlxtend.frequent_patterns.
•	Enables the extraction of frequent itemsets and generation of association rules.

3. Collections (Counter):
•	Imported from the collections module for counting occurrences of elements, especially in generating frequent itemsets.

4. Tabulate:
•	Utilized for displaying data in a tabular format, enhancing readability and presentation of results.
