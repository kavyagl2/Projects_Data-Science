Spam Detection System: Machine Learning Approach with Python and NLTK (January 2024) 

Project Description: The project focuses on developing a spam detection system using machine learning techniques. It aims to distinguish between spam and non-spam (ham) messages effectively. By utilizing natural language processing (NLP) and classification algorithms, the system can classify incoming messages as either spam or ham, contributing to improved email filtering and user experience.

Core Technologies Utilized:
-	Python: The project is primarily developed using Python programming language.
-	Scikit-learn: Scikit-learn is utilized for implementing machine learning models, including Multinomial Naive Bayes.
-	NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): NLTK provides essential tools for natural language processing tasks, such as tokenization and stopwords removal.
-	WordCloud: WordCloud is utilized for generating visual representations of most frequent words in spam and ham messages, aiding in exploratory data analysis.
-	Pandas: Pandas is used for data manipulation and analysis.
-	TfidfVectorizer: TfidfVectorizer from Scikit-learn is employed for converting text data into numerical feature vectors based on TF-IDF representation, crucial for training machine learning models.
-	Confusion Matrix: Confusion matrix visualization is employed to evaluate model performance.
