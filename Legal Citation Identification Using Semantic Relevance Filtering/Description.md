Project Description: This project aims to develop a system for identifying relevant legal citations within text documents using a Semantic Relevance Filtering algorithm.

Core Technologies Utilized:
-	Natural Language Processing (NLP) with spaCy: SpaCy is employed for named entity recognition, enabling the extraction of relevant entities from the input text.
-	Text Vectorization with TF-IDF: The TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) technique is utilized to convert text data into numerical vectors, facilitating cosine similarity calculation.
-	Cosine Similarity Calculation: The cosine similarity metric is computed between the TF-IDF vectors of the input text and predefined keywords/named entities to identify relevant citations.
-	Evaluation Metrics (Precision, Recall, F1 Score): Precision, recall, and F1 score are calculated to evaluate the system's performance in identifying relevant citations.
-	PDF Text Extraction with PDFPlumber: PDFPlumber is employed to extract text data from PDF documents, enabling the system to process legal documents stored in PDF format.
