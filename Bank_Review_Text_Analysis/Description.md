Project Description: The project aims to analyze customer reviews on banks to derive insights into customer sentiments, preferences, and areas of improvement. By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques, the project extracts valuable information from textual data, including topics, key phrases, and sentiment analysis. Additionally, the project employs topic modelling algorithms to categorize reviews into meaningful topics, providing a comprehensive understanding of customer feedback.

Core Technologies Utilized:
-	Seaborn: Seaborn complements Matplotlib by providing a high-level interface for creating attractive statistical graphics.
-	Hugging Face Datasets Library: This library is utilized to access the dataset containing customer reviews on banks.
-	NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): NLTK is used for text preprocessing tasks such as tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming.
-	Gensim: Gensim is employed for topic modeling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to discover latent topics in the customer reviews.
-	pyLDAvis: pyLDAvis is used for visualizing the topics generated by the LDA model in an interactive manner.
-	WordCloud: WordCloud is utilized to visualize the most frequent words and phrases in the customer reviews.
-	spaCy: spaCy is employed for named entity recognition (NER) to identify product and organization entities mentioned in the reviews.
-	TfidfVectorizer: TfidfVectorizer from scikit-learn is utilized to compute the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) scores for extracting keywords and phrases from the reviews.
-	BERTopic: BERTopic is used for topic modeling based on BERT embeddings, providing a more sophisticated approach to discovering topics in textual data.
-	Rake_NLTK: Rake_NLTK is employed for keyword extraction, especially for identifying influential authors based on the likes received on their reviews.
