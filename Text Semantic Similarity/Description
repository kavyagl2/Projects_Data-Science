Project Description: The project is a web application developed to calculate the similarity between two texts using advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques. It offers users the flexibility to either upload a CSV file containing text pairs or manually enter two texts for comparison. The application leverages state-of-the-art sentence embeddings generated by the DistilBERT model and computes similarity scores based on cosine similarity between the embeddings. This project is particularly useful for various NLP tasks such as duplicate detection, information retrieval, and recommendation systems.
Core Technologies Utilized: 
-	Streamlit: Streamlit is used as the primary framework for building the web application. It enables rapid development of interactive web interfaces for data-driven applications using simple Python scripts.
-	Pandas: Pandas is employed for data manipulation and handling CSV files. It is used to read uploaded CSV files, extract text pairs, and create dataframes for processing.
-	Sentence Transformers: The Sentence Transformers library is utilized to load pre-trained transformer models for generating sentence embeddings. In this project, the DistilBERT model with mean pooling (distilbert-base-nli-stsb-mean-tokens) is used to encode input texts into fixed-dimensional embeddings.
-	scikit-learn: The scikit-learn library is used to calculate cosine similarity between pairs of sentence embeddings. The cosine_similarity function from the sklearn.metrics.pairwise module is employed for this purpose.
